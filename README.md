# Rate Yildiz

A little website for rating teachers in YTU

## Notes

This whole thing needs a refactor, I did make some changes on the way, like changing "English" to "Teaching Skills",
but I only changed the UI, I couldn't bother with migrating the database. Another inconsistency you might notice is
the "Professors" in the backend are called "Teachers", this happened after I realized Avesis has assistant info too.

## To Do

* cache the leaderboards, they are too expensive
* better search
* refactor
